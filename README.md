Based off the fantastic Flask + EsiPy Example found [here](https://github.com/Kyria/flask-esipy-example).

## INSTALLATION:
Follow the Flask + EsiPy [instructions](https://github.com/Kyria/flask-esipy-example).

## USAGE:
1. Start the webserver and go to http://localhost:5015/
2. Click the login button to get you first character's api info.
3. For each subsequent character, click add character.
4. For every character, click update data to fetch their mining history.
5. Observe pretty graphs.

## OTHER NOTES:
This runs a local server so all your data stays on your machine.  I only tested it with Cygwin on Windows but it's python so in theory it works on everything.
